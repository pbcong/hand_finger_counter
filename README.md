# hand_finger_counter
- A model that counts the number of fingers raised in real time using your webcam
- I used the cv model for video and image processing
- Leveraged the mediapipe model from Google for hands and hand's joints detection
- Use a simple mathematical algorithm that calculate the angle between the joint for accurate detection of the fingers raised


How to use:
Download the hand_finger_count.ipynb using this command:
```
curl -o hand_finger_count.ipynb https://github.com/pbcong/hand_finger_counter/blob/main/hand_finger_count.ipynb
```
Install the dependencies (if needed):
```
pip install opencv-python, mediapipe, numpy
```

And run the codes!
